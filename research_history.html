    <h1>The history of artificial intelligence research</h1>

    In the mid- 20th century , a few scientists began exploring a new approach to building intelligent machines , based on recent 
discoveries in neuroscience , a new mathematical theory of information , the development of cybernetics , and above all, by 
 the invention of the digital computer , a machine that could simulate The human computational thinking process . 

   He established the modern field of artificial intelligence research at a conference on the campus of Dartmouth College 
in the summer of 1956 .  They became leaders of attendance intelligence research artificial for several decades, 
especially John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, Allen Newell and Herbert Simon , who founded the laboratories of 
artificial intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) 
and Stanford, they and their pupils have written programs entranced by most people .
The computer was solving algebra problems, proving logical theorems, and speaking English .
By the mid-1960s, this research was being generously funded by the US Department of Defense . 
These researchers made the following predictions:
* 1965, e. a. Simon: "machines will be capable, within twenty years, to do any work can be done by man ." 
* 1967, Marvin Minsky: "Within a generation...the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will be largely solved."
But they failed to realize the difficulty of some of the problems they faced.  In 1974, in response to 
criticism from England's Sir James Lightttle and persistent pressure from Congress to fund more productive projects, 
the US and British governments cut funding for all undirected exploratory research in AI, the first setback for AI research. 

   In the early 1980s , AI research experienced a new revival through the commercial success of "expert systems", 
an AI program that simulates the knowledge and analytical skills of one or more human experts.
 By 1985 , AI research profits in the marketplace had reached more than $1 billion, and governments began funding again.
 A few years later, starting with the collapse of the machine market the Lisp Machine (one of programming languages ) 
 in 1987, artificial intelligence research has seen another setback but longer. 

   In the 1990s and early 2000s , artificial intelligence achieved greater successes, albeit somewhat behind the scenes.
AI is used in logistics , data mining , medical diagnostics and many other areas across the technology industry . 
This success is due to several factors: the great power of computers today (see Moore's Law ), the increased focus on 
solving specific sub-problems, the creation of new relationships between the field of artificial intelligence and other
 areas of work on similar problems, and above all researchers began to commit With strong mathematical curricula 
 and strict scientific standards. 
   In the twenty-first century, AI research has become so highly specialized and technical, that it has split into 
   so deeply independent sub-fields that they are few among themselves. Divisions of the field have grown around 
   particular institutions, researchers have worked to solve specific problems, long-standing differences of opinion 
   about how AI should work, and different tools are widely applied.
